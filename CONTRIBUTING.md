# Contributing Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines for contributing to this project.

## Repository Management

- Fork this project into your own repository.
- Follow the [version control](#version control) guidelines.
- No changes should reach the `main` branch except by way of a [pull
    request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

### Submitting Issues

[Create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue) to report bugs or request enhancements. Better yet, you're encouraged to fix the problem yourself and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

#### Bug Reports

When reporting a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce the problem and any details that could be important such as whether this is the first time this has happened or whether others are experiencing it.

#### Pull Requests

Pull requests must remain focused on fixing or addressing one thing (see [topic branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows#Topic-Branches) model). Make sure your pull request contains a clear title and description. Test coverage should not drop as a result. If you add code, you add tests.

Be sure to follow the guidelines on [writing code](#writing-code) if you want your work considered for inclusion.

### Handling Pull Requests

- Pull requests **must** include:
  - Title describing the change
  - Description explaining the change in detail
  - Tests
- A maintainer will respond to Pull Requests with one of:
  - `Ship It`, `LGTM`, ðŸš¢, or some other affirmation
  - What must be changed
  - Won't accept and why

> Submitting a [draft pull
request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests)
is a good way to get feedback from maintainers if you are unsure about
your changes. - A pull request that has been approved may not be merged
immediately. - You may be asked to rebase or squash your commits to keep
an orderly version control history.

### Using Version Control

- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [central repository](https://github.com/drearondov/pygments-rose-pines/) and work from a clone of your own fork.
- Follow the [topic branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows#Topic-Branches) model and submit pull requests from branches named according to their purpose.
- Review the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) documentation and, in general, try to stick to the principles outlined there.

## Writing Code

Writing code is a creative process and there will always be exceptions to the rules, but it\'s good to maintain certain standards. In general, please follow these code conventions.

### Coding Style

- Code in this project **must** be formatted with [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- Code in this project **must** be linted with [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).
- Try to follow PEP8 guidelines.
- Try to respect the style of existing code.

Coding style checks are bundled into the static analysis automation in this repository\'s [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) configuration. To validate your coding style run

``` sh
tox -e static
```

### Test Environment

- Code **must** be tested. Write or update related unit tests to avoid
    repeated manual testing.
- Tests for this project are written using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) framework and executed via [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- While it isn\'t always achievable this project strives to maintain ðŸ’¯% test coverage.
- In addition to unit testing code in this project is
  - statically type checked using [mypy](http://www.mypy-lang.org/)
  - formatted with [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  - linted using [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
  - and security checked with [bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Here are some example invocations for running unit tests/static
analysis.

``` sh
tox                        # Build and test the project
tox -e py39                # in a specific environment
tox -e py39 -- --pdb       # with extra options,
                           # or
tox -e py39 --devenv venv  # create a development environment
venv/bin/python -V         # and call scripts/binaries in it.
```

### Documentation

- Public interfaces **must** be thoroughly documented. At a minimum this includes inputs, return types, exceptions raised, and surprising behavior like state changes.
- Documentation for this project is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) and generated with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html).
